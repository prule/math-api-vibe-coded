"MUST" rules are enforced in review or by the build. "SHOULD" rules may be broken with a stated reason in the PR.

## 1. Stack

| Concern | Choice |
|---------|--------|
| Language | Java 25 (Gradle toolchain) |
| Framework | Spring Boot 4.1.2 (webmvc, validation, actuator) |
| Build | Gradle 9.8.2, Kotlin DSL, wrapper committed (`./gradlew`) |
| API docs | springdoc-openapi 3.2.0 (`springdoc-openapi-starter-webmvc-ui`), OpenAPI 3.1 |
| Tests | JUnit (Boot-managed version), AssertJ, Spring Boot Test, ArchUnit 1.5.1 |
| Formatting | Spotless 8.11.0 + palantir-java-format 2.103.0 (Java); ktlint (`*.gradle.kts`) |
| Group / base package | `com.paulrule` / `com.paulrule.mathapi` |

New dependencies MUST be justified in the PR that adds them.

## 2. Architecture — clean architecture, single module

```
com.paulrule.mathapi
├── domain            entities, value objects, Operation enum, domain exceptions
├── application       use cases (e.g. PerformCalculation), ports
├── adapter.in.web    controllers, request/response DTOs, Problem Details mapping
└── config            Spring wiring (@Configuration), the only place use cases become beans
```

Dependency rule — arrows point inwards only:

```
adapter.in.web ──► application ──► domain
config ──────────► all
```

- `domain` MUST NOT import Spring, Jakarta, Jackson or any framework. Plain Java only.
- `application` MUST NOT import Spring web or adapter types. Use cases are plain classes wired in `config`.
- `adapter.in.web` MUST NOT contain business rules; it parses, delegates, maps.
- DTOs MUST NOT leak into `application` or `domain`; map at the adapter boundary.
- These rules MUST be enforced by ArchUnit tests that run in `./gradlew build`.
- Future outbound adapters (e.g. persistence) go in `adapter.out.<name>` behind a port declared in `application`.

## 3. Domain conventions

- Numbers are `BigDecimal`; never `double`/`float` for values.
- Business rules are documented in [DOMAIN-MODEL.md](DOMAIN-MODEL.md) with an ID (`BR-n`). Code enforcing a rule and its tests SHOULD cite the ID in the test name or a comment.
- Adding an operation: add the `Operation` constant with its arity (1 or 2), document its rules in DOMAIN-MODEL.md, add tests. Nothing else should need to change; if something does, the design has drifted — fix it.
- Domain failures are domain exceptions, never HTTP-aware.

## 4. API conventions

- Base path `/api/v{n}`. Adding an operation is non-breaking. Breaking changes → new major path version.
- Request/response bodies are Java records.
- Decimal values in responses (Operands, Results) are JSON strings (plain notation); requests accept numbers or strings. Small counts with no precision to lose, such as an Operation's `arity`, are JSON integers.
- Errors MUST be RFC 9457 Problem Details via Spring `ProblemDetail`, from a single `@RestControllerAdvice`. Each error has a stable `type` URI listed in the PRD.
- Status codes: `400` invalid input; `422` valid input that violates a domain rule.
- Every endpoint MUST appear correctly in the generated OpenAPI docs: an explicit `@ApiResponse` for each status it returns (including the 200's media type, which springdoc otherwise documents as `*/*`), and a `application/problem+json` example for each Problem Details `type`. `ApiDocumentationTest` enforces this; extend it with every new endpoint or error type.
- Documented values that come from the domain (e.g. allowed `operation` names) MUST be generated from it (`config.OpenApiConfig`), never copied into annotations.

## 5. Code style

- Spotless (palantir-java-format) MUST pass; `./gradlew spotlessApply` before committing.
- Use records for DTOs and value objects. No Lombok.
- Prefer immutability; no setters in domain.
- Comment the *why*, not the *what*.
- No speculative abstraction: build what the current PRD scope needs.

## 6. Testing

Write tests first (red → green → refactor).

| Level | Tool | Must cover |
|-------|------|-----------|
| Domain unit | JUnit + AssertJ | Every operation and every edge case listed in DOMAIN-MODEL.md; every business rule |
| Web slice | MockMvc web-slice test | Controller mapping, request parsing, every Problem Details error path in the PRD |
| Smoke | `@SpringBootTest` (one) | Context starts; one happy-path request end to end |
| API docs | `@SpringBootTest` (`ApiDocumentationTest`) | The generated OpenAPI document, §4; its examples equal real responses |
| Profile | `@SpringBootTest` + `@ActiveProfiles` (one per profile file) | Each `application-<profile>.yaml` behaves as §8 says (e.g. `ApiDocumentationDisabledTest`) |
| Architecture | ArchUnit | Section 2 dependency rules |

- No coverage-percentage gate. Instead: every operation, every business rule and every error path MUST have a test.
- Test names describe behaviour: `dividesOneByThreeToThirtyFourSignificantDigits`.

## 7. Workflow

- Every change is one backlog item: prompt the agent with the item, review the code (`/ponytail:ponytail-review` and `/code-review`), fix the review findings, write a retrospective in `retrospectives/`, then open a PR and squash merge on green CI.
- Commits follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`).
- Hosted on GitHub. PRs use `.github/pull_request_template.md`.
- CI (GitHub Actions, `.github/workflows/build.yml`) MUST run `./gradlew build` (tests, ArchUnit, Spotless) on every PR and push to `main`.
- **Docs stay current:** a change that alters scope, API, operations, domain rules or these standards MUST update PRD.md, DOMAIN-MODEL.md or STANDARDS.md in the same PR, including the doc's change log.

## 8. Configuration & profiles

- `src/main/resources/application.yaml` holds the **local-development defaults**: what `./gradlew bootRun` and the tests use with no profile.
- Environment-specific overrides go in `application-<profile>.yaml`, activated with `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=<profile>`. Override only what differs, and comment why.
- **`prod`** is the profile for any environment reachable beyond developers. Today it turns off API docs (`springdoc.api-docs.enabled`, `springdoc.swagger-ui.enabled`) and Spring's static-resource handlers (`spring.web.resources.add-mappings`, which would otherwise still serve the swagger-ui webjar). Deployments MUST set `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=prod`.
- Every profile file MUST have a `@ActiveProfiles` test proving its behaviour (e.g. `ApiDocumentationDisabledTest`).
- Single settings can be overridden per environment with Spring's standard environment variables (e.g. `SPRINGDOC_API_DOCS_ENABLED=true`). Don't add custom properties that duplicate a library's own switches.

## 9. Change log

| Date | Change |
|------|--------|
| 2026-11-10 | Copied from math-api (its final v1 docs) for the one-agent rerun with reviews from the start |
| 2026-11-13 | §6: `ApiDocumentationTest` is a second `@SpringBootTest`, needed because springdoc is not part of the web slice |
| 2026-11-13 | §6: one `@ActiveProfiles` `@SpringBootTest` per profile file, as §8 already requires |
